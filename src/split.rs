//! Splits a single [`Service`] implementing all of ABCI into four cloneable
//! component services, each implementing one category of ABCI requests.
//!
//! The component services share access to the main service via message-passing
//! over buffered channels. This means that the component services can be cloned
//! to provide shared access to the ABCI application, which processes
//! requests sequentially with the following prioritization:
//!
//! 1. [`ConsensusRequest`]s sent to the [`Consensus`] service;
//! 2. [`MempoolRequest`]s sent to the [`Mempool`] service;
//! 3. [`SnapshotRequest`]s sent to the [`Snapshot`] service;
//! 4. [`InfoRequest`]s sent to the [`Info`] service.
//!
//! The ABCI service can execute these requests synchronously, in
//! [`Service::call`](tower::Service::call), or asynchronously, by immediately
//! returning a future that will be executed on the caller's task. Or, it can
//! split the difference and perform some amount of synchronous work and defer
//! the rest to be performed asynchronously.
//!
//! Because each category of requests is handled by a different service, request
//! behavior can be customized on a per-category basis using Tower
//! [`Layer`](tower::Layer)s. For instance, load-shedding can be added to
//! [`InfoRequest`]s but not [`ConsensusRequest`]s, or different categories can
//! have different timeout policies, or different types of instrumentation.
